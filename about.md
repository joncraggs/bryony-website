Bryony Reynolds is an actor specialising in Shakespeare and the classics. Theatre highlights include the award winning Macbeth the Musical (White Bear Theatre), Twelfth Night (Mission Theatre, Bath), Theatre Without Sight or Sound (Old Red Lion), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Bread & Roses Theatre), Twelfth Night (RSC Dell Theatre), Macbeth (YSC National tour), and Shakespeare in Hell (Exeter Northcott Theatre).

Growing up overseas in Asia and Australasia, her upbringing has given her a deep cultural awareness that has fuelled her drive for the protection of both gender and racial equality. "I am particularly drawn to stage work, in its ability to break down barriers in society and remind people of what’s important.”

Reynolds’ work spans across stage and screen, comedy and tragedy, classical and contemporary, indoor and outdoor theatre, touring and regional performances and everything in-between. Her performances across all genres have been given outstanding reviews, and companies, directors, and actors alike have frequently requested to work with her again.
